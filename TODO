What is the problem ?
- Given two files consists of strings we have to match strings from each file.

What is the matching condition? 
- The last four characters of the string from first file will be the last four characters of the string from second file.

 Ex: 70oklw -> string from file 1
     oklw737 -> string from file 2
     
 These two strings are matched and the expected string is -> 79oklw737.

How the input should be arranged ?
- file1 strings -> [string1 ,  string2, string3, ..., stringN]
- file2 strings -> {
  oklw: 737, 
  bdxv: 211, 
  .
  .
  .
  first four characters of string : remaining characters of the string
}

What is the expected output?
79oklw737
381jstc331
453usja514
535bdxv211
